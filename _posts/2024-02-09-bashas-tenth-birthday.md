Today is my baby girl's birthday!!!  

Time flies so fast.  I remember taking you to your first grooming session.  I didn't know then how important it is to comb your fur if not for the groomer.  I remember that we asked the groomer to heat up some water so that you can take a warm bath.  You were very brave then.  I didn't remember any instance when you cried or were squirmished in perhaps the most frightening day of your life.  Afterwards we tied a ribbon on your hair.  I still have a picture of that on my tablet.  

Oh how time flies so fast.  You're now ten.  You've undergone three births. Two of your babies Miggy and Noisy are here with us today.  Your hair is now black, when it was white 10 years ago.  You had some lumps on your body, but fortunately nothing serious and you still have that same curiousity and vigor when there is a commotion inside or outside the house.  You may have slowed down a little.  But you're still my baby, my baby girl.
